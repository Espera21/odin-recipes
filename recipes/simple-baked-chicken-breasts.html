        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.<br> 
                Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li><br>    
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.<br>
                Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more.<br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li><br>  
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula.<br>
                Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li><br>  
            <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
