What is it, tho?

"odin-recipes" is originally a project to practice and deepen fundamental HTML and Git working methods.
I plan to come back to this project now and then to implement new content, as I gain more skills and knowledge.
By creating a long term GitHub-project, I'm gonna be able to look at my improvements over time, 
and get a feeling for good and bad commit habits/practices.
If this website still looks like shit after a long time, 
I was probably one of those people who weren't persistent enough, or I'm dead, or our civilization collapsed.
